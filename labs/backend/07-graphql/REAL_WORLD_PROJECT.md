# Real World Project: GraphQL

## Project
a storefront API serving product graphs via Spring GraphQL.

## Why it matters
In production, GraphQL is rarely a library detail — it is an architectural commitment. Teams choose it to flexible client-driven data fetching.

## Architecture sketch
```
Client -> API Gateway -> GraphQL Service -> Datastore
                |               |
                +-> Observability (logs/metrics/traces)
```

## Implementation notes
- Prefer constructor injection and small, testable components.
- Keep the happy path pure; isolate side effects.
- Version the contract and document it (OpenAPI/schema).
- Add timeouts, retries with backoff, and a circuit breaker at the boundary.
- Emit RED metrics (rate, errors, duration) and structured logs.

## Failure modes to design for
- Downstream timeout or partial failure.
- Retry storms amplifying load.
- Hidden shared mutable state across threads.
- Consistency windows between writes and reads.

## Testing the real thing
- Unit-test the service with mocks.
- Slice-test the web layer.
- Integration-test with Testcontainers against a real dependency.
- Load-test the p99 path with a small k6 script.
