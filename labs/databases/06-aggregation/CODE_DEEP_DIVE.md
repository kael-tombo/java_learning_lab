# Aggregation — Code Deep Dive

## Layered architecture
```
Client → JDBC/JPA → Driver → Network → Database Engine → Storage
```

## Key code paths
### Path 1: aggregation request lifecycle
```java
// Aggregation — path 1
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 2: aggregation request lifecycle
```java
// Aggregation — path 2
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 3: aggregation request lifecycle
```java
// Aggregation — path 3
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 4: aggregation request lifecycle
```java
// Aggregation — path 4
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 5: aggregation request lifecycle
```java
// Aggregation — path 5
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 6: aggregation request lifecycle
```java
// Aggregation — path 6
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 7: aggregation request lifecycle
```java
// Aggregation — path 7
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 8: aggregation request lifecycle
```java
// Aggregation — path 8
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
