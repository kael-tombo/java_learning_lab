# Ctes — Real World Project

## Scenario
Design and implement a production-shaped system where ctes is a first-class requirement: correctness under failure, measurable performance, and safe rollout.

## Architecture
```
App (Spring Boot) → Repo/JDBC → Database → Replication/Backup → Observability
```

## Implementation sketch
```java
@Repository
public interface OrderRepo extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {
    @Query("select o from Order o where o.status = :s")
    List<Order> findByStatus(String s);
}
```

## Requirements

- F6: ctes capability 6 with acceptance test.
- F7: ctes capability 7 with acceptance test.
- F8: ctes capability 8 with acceptance test.
- F9: ctes capability 9 with acceptance test.
- F10: ctes capability 10 with acceptance test.
- NF1: p95 latency, backup RPO/RTO, and security baseline for ctes.
- NF2: p95 latency, backup RPO/RTO, and security baseline for ctes.
- NF3: p95 latency, backup RPO/RTO, and security baseline for ctes.
- NF4: p95 latency, backup RPO/RTO, and security baseline for ctes.
- NF5: p95 latency, backup RPO/RTO, and security baseline for ctes.
- NF6: p95 latency, backup RPO/RTO, and security baseline for ctes.

## Milestones
- Week 1: deliver increment 1 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 2: deliver increment 2 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 3: deliver increment 3 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 4: deliver increment 4 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 5: deliver increment 5 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 6: deliver increment 6 with tests and a short design note.

## Verification
- Load test, failure injection, backup restore drill — all must pass before sign-off.
