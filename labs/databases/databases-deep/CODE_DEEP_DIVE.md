# Databases Deep — Code Deep Dive

## Layered architecture
```
Client → JDBC/JPA → Driver → Network → Database Engine → Storage
```

## Key code paths
### Path 1: databases deep request lifecycle
```java
// Databases Deep — path 1
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 2: databases deep request lifecycle
```java
// Databases Deep — path 2
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 3: databases deep request lifecycle
```java
// Databases Deep — path 3
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 4: databases deep request lifecycle
```java
// Databases Deep — path 4
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 5: databases deep request lifecycle
```java
// Databases Deep — path 5
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 6: databases deep request lifecycle
```java
// Databases Deep — path 6
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 7: databases deep request lifecycle
```java
// Databases Deep — path 7
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
Notes: watch for N+1 queries, missing fetch size, and unclosed resources.

### Path 8: databases deep request lifecycle
```java
// Databases Deep — path 8
try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    ps.setFetchSize(200);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
    while (rs.next()) { /* materialize */ }
}
```
