# Pl Sql Advanced — Real World Project

## Scenario
Design and implement a production-shaped system where pl sql advanced is a first-class requirement: correctness under failure, measurable performance, and safe rollout.

## Architecture
```
App (Spring Boot) → Repo/JDBC → Database → Replication/Backup → Observability
```

## Implementation sketch
```java
@Repository
public interface OrderRepo extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {
    @Query("select o from Order o where o.status = :s")
    List<Order> findByStatus(String s);
}
```

## Milestones
- Week 1: deliver increment 1 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 2: deliver increment 2 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 3: deliver increment 3 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 4: deliver increment 4 with tests and a short design note.
- Week 5: deliver increment 5 with tests and a short design note.

## Verification
- Load test, failure injection, backup restore drill — all must pass before sign-off.
